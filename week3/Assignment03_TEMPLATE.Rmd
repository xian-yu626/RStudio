## 2.1(Q1)
1. Random Experiment: A random experiment is an experiment or a process for which the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.
2. Sample Space:
The sample space, often denoted as S or Î©, refers to the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. It encompasses every conceivable result for the given experiment
3. Event: An event is any subset of the sample space. It represents a specific set of outcomes of a random experiment that we might be interested in.
