## Load packages

First, we load the following two packages. 

1. tidyverse: a collection of R packages designed for data science, including packages for visualization ggplot2, for tidying data tidyr, for data manipulation dplyr, and for functional programming purrr, etc.

2. palmerpenguins: the Palmer penguins data set, Introduced by Alison Hill, Allison Horst, Kristen Gorman. We will use this data set to demonstrate how to implement basic data wrangling tasks in R. 

To use the packages, you need to install them first (and they only need to be done once). Once they are installed, They can be loaded using the following statements. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```



### About the data frame: penguins

The palmerpenguins package contains a Palmer penguins dataset stored as a data frame, called "penguins". This is what penguins looks like:


```{r}
head(penguins)

```


In this example, penguins has 8 columns, which respectively correspond to:

[1] "species"          
[2] "island"           
[3] "bill_length_mm"   
[4] "bill_depth_mm"    
[5] "flipper_length_mm"
[6] "body_mass_g"      
[7] "sex"              
[8] "year"    

We will see how to do data wrangling using this example. 


## Data wrangling


### 1. selecting columns (select)

Select a subset of the columns and create a new data frame (which we call "penguinsv2"). 
We will use the function select (a function from the package dplyr)

```{r}
penguinsv2 <- select(penguins, species, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm )
print(penguinsv2)
```

Here penguinsv2 contains only 4 columns, while the original penguins data has 8. 
We shall use frequently penguinsv2 to create examples in the subsequent. 

The function select() can be also used to remove columns (using the syntax '-'), e.g., 

```{r}
select(penguins, -species, -bill_length_mm, -body_mass_g)
```

### 2. filtering rows (filter)

To select a subset of rows from a dataset, we use the filter function. For example, 

```{r}
filter(penguinsv2, species=='Gentoo')

```

We can select the rows using multiple criteria (using the expression '&' )
```{r}
filter(penguinsv2, species=='Gentoo' & body_mass_g>5000)

```

The functions select and filter can be used together (to select a subset of columns and a subset of rows)

```{r}
select(filter(penguinsv2, species=='Gentoo'), species, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)
```



Note: the above statement can be simplified using the pip operator %>%.
The pip operator can be found in the magrittr or dplyr package.
A simplified version of the code: 

```{r}
penguinsv2 %>%
  filter(species=='Gentoo') %>%
  select(species, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)

```

Another example of how to use the pip operator %>%

```{r}
f <- function(a,b) {return (a^2 + b) }
print(f(3,1))
print( 3 %>% f(1) )

```

In summary,  
**x %<% f1(a) %<% f2(b) %<% f3(c) ** 
means 
**f3(f2(f1(x, a), b), c) **. 


We will use  %<% to simplify our code in the rest of this R Markdown. 


### 3. create a new column (mutate)

The mutate function allows us to create a new column as a function of existing columns.

```{r}
penguinsv2 %>%
  mutate(flipper_bill_ratio=flipper_length_mm/bill_length_mm)
```


### 4. rename a column (rename)

```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% rename(f_l_m = flipper_length_mm)

```


### 5. sort the rows (arrange)

To sort the rows in penguinsv2 according to bill_length_mm (in ascending order):

```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% arrange(bill_length_mm)

```


to sort the rows in penguinsv2 according to bill_length_mm (in descending order):
```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% arrange(desc(bill_length_mm))

```


### 6. summarize the data frame (summarize)


Summarize the data frame into just one value or vector (e.g., compute the mean, median, sum, standard deviation, ... of a column)

```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% 
  summarize(num_rows=n(), avg_weight_kg=mean(body_mass_g/1000, na.rm=TRUE), avg_flipper_bill_ratio=mean(flipper_length_mm/bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE))

```

The three columns in the output mean "number of rows", "average body mass", "average flipper_length_mm/bill_length_mm", respectively.  
The "na.rm=TRUE" stands for the option of removing the rows that contain the NA (not available) value. So the NA values will not contribute to the calculation of the mean here


NB: We can the function group_by to group the rows of the data frames according to some criteria, e.g. species: 
```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% 
  group_by(species) 

```


Summarizing the data on individual groups (instead of the whole data frames):
```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% 
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(num_rows=n(), avg_weight_kg=mean(body_mass_g/1000, na.rm=TRUE), avg_flipper_bill_ratio=mean(flipper_length_mm/bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE))

```



Use across to perform column-wise operations (for all columns), which out copying and pasting the same code (e.g., sum(is.na(species)), ...)

```{r}
Num_NAs <- penguinsv2 %>% summarize(species=sum(is.na(species)), bill_length_mm=sum(is.na(bill_length_mm)), body_mass_g=sum(is.na(body_mass_g)), flipper_length_mm=sum(is.na(flipper_length_mm)))
print(Num_NAs)

Num_NAs <- penguinsv2 %>% summarize(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.x))))
print(Num_NAs)
```


Use across to perform column-wise operations (for a subset of columns, for example, that is of numeric type)
```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% summarize(across(where(is.numeric), ~mean(.x, na.rm=TRUE)))

```


With the operations, it is then possible to do a sequence of data-wrangling tasks, by combining the functions. 
An example of combining the summarize, groupby and across functions:

```{r}
penguinsv2 %>% 
  select(-bill_length_mm) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), ~mean(.x, na.rm=TRUE)))

```


### 7. Joining multiple data frames into a single one (join).


First we extract a data frame of bill lengths by species.
```{r}
penguin_bill_lengths_df <- penguinsv2 %>%
  arrange(desc(bill_length_mm)) %>%
  select(species, bill_length_mm) 
penguin_bill_lengths_df

```


Next we create a data frame of Latin species names.

```{r}
species <- unique(penguinsv2$species)
latin_name <- c('Pygoscelis adeliae', 'Pygoscelis papua', 'Pygoscelis antarcticus')
latin_name_df <- data.frame( species, latin_name  )
print(latin_name_df)

```

Finally we can fuse these two data frames with a join function.
```{r}
penguin_bill_lengths_df %>% inner_join(latin_name_df)

```


What happens when the set of values on the common column is not the same for both tables? For example:

```{r}
print(band_members)
print(band_instruments)
x = band_members
y = band_instruments
```


Simplified names x, y:
```{r}
print(x)
print(y)
```



The 1st option is to do an inner join. 
An inner join means only rows with matching keys in both x and y are included in the result. 
```{r}
inner_join(x, y)
```


The 2nd option is to do a full join. The full join (also known as an outer join) means to include all rows in x with matching columns in y, then the rows of y that don't match x.

```{r}
full_join(x, y)

```


The 3rd option is to do a left join, which means to include all rows in x, adding matching columns from y. 
```{r}
left_join(x, y)
```



The last option is to do a right join, which means to include all rows in y, adding matching columns from x. 
```{r}
right_join(x, y)
```
